# Bikeshare Professional Data Analysis nd
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in USA inclding Washington, Chicago, and New York City.

## Getting Started
The following installation instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development or testing purposes. The prerequisite section will help you understand the things you will need in order to run this use ana run this project correctly.

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

  - Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57).
  - End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53).
  - Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776).
  - Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave).
  - End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave).
  - User Type (Subscriber or Customer).
  
The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
  - Gender.

 ## Files
  - Data.zip contains all data used(chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv) 
  - bikeshare.py
  
 ## How to run
 In order to run this unzip the 'Data' file and copy the 3 .csv files to the main directory with the bikeshare.py file and use the terminal to run the file.
